# Whistle Data Transformation Language reference

## Background

The Whistle Data Transformation Language expresses data mappings from one schema
to another. It lets users transform complex, nested data formats into other
complex and nested data formats. This document lists out the features available
in Whistle.

## Running your mappings

-   Run your mapping using the mapping_engine binary, in mapping_engine/main.
    An example command might look like (run from mapping_engine/main):
    `go run . -input_file_spec=<PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE_OR_DIR>
    -output_dir=<PATH_TO_INPUT_DIR>
    -mapping_file_spec=<PATH_TO_MAPPING_FILE>`

### All available flags

*   input_file_spec: Input data file or directory (JSON)
*   output_dir: Path to the directory where the output will be written to. Leave
    empty to print to stdout
*   mapping_file_spec: Mapping file
*   lib_dir_spec: Path to the directory where the library mapping files are
*   harmonize_code_dir_spec:
    [FHIR ConceptMaps](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap.html) used for code
    harmonization
*   harmonize_unit_spec: Unit harmonization config
    ([textproto](http://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/blob/master/mapping_engine/proto/harmonization.proto))
*   data_harmonization_config_file_spec: Data harmonization config
    ([textproto](http://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/blob/master/mapping_engine/proto/data_harmonization.proto)).

## Mapping

Mapping is the most basic operation of the mapping engine. There are several
different types of mappings that can be expressed.

### Field

You can map a field from the input JSON to a field in the output JSON. The
output JSON field is on the left, seperated by a : and the input field is on the
right.

E.g.

```
patient_name: input_json.name;
```

Any nested fields can be written to directly, without needing to explicitly
create the JSON structure.

E.g.

```
patient.name: input_json.name;
```

> NOTE: By default, all fields are present in the output. For fields that should
> not be present in the output, use variables.

A field can contain spaces, dots or any special characters by escaping them with
a <code><span>&#92;</span></code> (or two backslashes for a literal backslash in
the field).

A field can be composed of any characters (e.x. unicode), or use reserved
Whistle keywords (like "var" or "required"), if it is quoted in single quotes.
Beware that all delimiters inside the quotes are preserved literally and are not
treated as delimiters in the path.

```
patient\.data.first\\name: input_json.first\ name
'patient.data'.'ðŸ˜Š': true
keyword.'var': "keywords must be quoted"
```

outputs:

```json
{
  "patient.data": {
    "first\\name": "...",
    "ðŸ˜Š": true
  },
  "keyword": {
    "var": "keywords must be quoted"
  }
}
```

NOTE: In the above example, the double <code><span>&#92;&#92;</span></code> is
the JSON escape for a single <code><span>&#92;</span></code>. This means the
above first name field, when parsed out of JSON, is `first\name`.

NOTE: Unicode characters are not currently escaped in the output JSON.

### Constant

You can map various different types of constants to the output fields.

#### String constants

Directly map constant strings.

```
patient_name: "John Doe";
```

#### Numeric constants

Directly map constant numerics.

```
patient_age_years: 25;
patient_age: 25.5;
```

#### Boolean constants

Directly map constant booleans.

```
patient_deceased: false;
patient_not_deceased: true;
```

#### Variable

Use variables to map to temporary fields that are not desired in the output.

```
// Writing to a variable.
var input_name: input_json.name

// Reading from a variable.
patient_name: input_name;
```

> NOTE: Variables take precedence over input fields if they have the same name.

### Nested mappings

Nested fields can also be described with blocks:

```
patient: {
  name: input_json.name
}
```

Variables inside blocks are scoped to that block for writes. E.g.,

```
var one: "one"
nested: {
  read: one
  var one: "two"
  // The above assignment declares a new variable called "one" for this block.
  inner: one
}
// The below "one" refers to the variable declared on the first line.
outter: one
```

outputs:

```json
{
  "nested": {
    "read": "one",
    "inner": "two"
  },
  "outter": "one"
}
```

### Functions

Mappings can be grouped together into a function, and this function can be
called by other mappings.

> NOTE: All mappings defined inside of a function are present in the function's
> output object but not the mapping's output object. Use [root]() or [out]() for
> outputting an object to the mapping's output object.

#### Defining a function

Functions are defined by the `def` keyword followed by the function name and the
list of parameters the function takes.

```
def PatientName(input) {
    patient_name: input.name
}

```

Arguments can have optional `required` keywords. Mappings in a function will
only be executed if **all** arguments with `required` keyword are not nil. For
example:

```
def PatientName(required requiredArg1, required requiredArg2, arg3) {
    ...mappings...
}
```

is equivalent to

```
def PatientName(requiredArg1, requiredArg2, arg3) {
    if $IsNotNil(requiredArg1) and $IsNotNil(requiredArg2) {
        ...mappings...
    }
}
```

#### Calling a function

Calling a function is similar to how you call functions in other programming
languages (e.g. C, Java, Python).

```
patient: PatientName(input_json)
```

Values passed to functions can also be objects, as described above, E.g.

```
patient: PatientName({
  first: "Jane"
  var initial: "J. "
  last:  $ToUpper($StrCat(initial, "Doe"))
})

// Or, equivalently
patient: PatientName({first: "Jane"; last:  "Doe";})
```

Note that variables are not passed along to `PatientName`.

#### Builtin functions

There are a number of builtin functions provided out of the box. Builtin
functions are prefixed with a `$`. The full documentation of the builtin
functions is available [here](http://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/blob/master/mapping_language/doc/builtins.md).

### Null propagation

By default, null and missing values/fields are ignored in accordance with the
following rules:

*   If a field is written with a null or empty value, it is ignored (thus
    `null`, `{}`, and `[]` can never show up in the mapping output)
*   If a non-existent field is accessed, it returns `null`

> NOTE: Functions are still executed even if its arguments are null.

### Merge semantics

Assigning a value to the same field results in a merge rather than an overwrite,
i.e:

*   Arrays are concatenated
    *   Even though both functions mapped to `colours[0]`, `"blue"` ended up in
        `colours[1]`
*   New fields are added
*   Similar fields produce a merge conflict. An overwrite can be forced (see
    [overwrite operator `!`](#overwrite-))

## Conditions

Mappings can be conditionally executed.

### Conditional Mapping

Conditional mapping allows a single mapping to be executed if and only if a
condition is true. Add the condition right before the `:`.

```
patient (if input_json.type = "Patient"): PatientName(input_json)
```

### Conditional Blocks

Conditional blocks allow wrapping a set of mappings within a condition. An
optional `else` allows executing mappings if the condition is not met.

```
def PatientName(input) {
  if input.type = "first" {
    first: input.value;
  } else {
    last: input.value;
  }
}
```

## Arrays

Arrays

### Iteration (`[]`)

To iterate an array, suffix the array with `[]`. For example:

*   `Function(a[])` means "pass each element of `a` (one at a time) to
    `Function`"
*   `Function(a[], b)` means "pass each element of `a` (one at a time), along
    with `b` to `Function`". If `b` is an array of the same length as `a` we can
    iterate them together
*   `Function(a[], b[])` means "pass each element of `a` (one at a time), along
    with each element of `b` (at the same index) to `Function`"
    *   An error is returned if `a` and `b` are of different lengths
*   `[]` is also allowed after function calls
    *   `Function2(Function(a)[])` means "pass each element from the result of
        `Function(a)` (one at a time) to `Function2`
*   The result of an iterating function call is also an array

### Appending (`[]`)

Suffixing a target with `[]` appends to the array. The array index can also be
used to write to a specific index.

*   Append to an array using `[]`
*   `[]` in the middle of the path (e.g. types[].typeName: ...) is valid as well
    and creates `types: [{"typeName": ... }]`
*   Hardcoded indexes can also be used (e.g.`types[0]: ...` and `types[1]: ...`)
*   "Out of bounds" indexes (e.g. `types[153]: ...` generates all the missing
    elements as `null`

### Wildcards (`[*]`)

In contrast to [iteration](#iteration-), the `[*]` syntax works like specifying
an index, except that it returns an array of values. Multiple arrays mapped
through with `[*]`, for example `a[*].b.c[*].d`, in one long, non-nested array
of the values of `d` with the same item order.

> NOTE: null values are included, through jagged traversal. E.g.:
> `a[*].b.c[*].d`, if some instance of a does not have b.c, then a single null
> value is returned for that instance.

### Filtering (`[where ...]`)

Filters allow narrowing an array to items that match a condition using the
following syntax:

*   The `where` keyword indicates a filter, similar to `if` indicating a
    condition
*   Each item from the array is loaded one at a time into a variable named `$`
    in the filter
    *   all fields of `$` are accessable
*   The filter produces a new array. To iterate over the results, use the `[]`
    operator
*   Filters can only be the last element in a path, i.e. `a.b[where $.color =
    "red"].c` is invalid

```
// Set males to all patients whose gender = "MALE".
males: patients[where $.gender = "MALE"];
```

## Post Processing (`post`)

Post processing allows running a function after the mapping is complete. The
input to the post processing function is the output from the mapping such that
the result becomes the new output. A `post` function must be the last thing in
the file.

<section class="zippy">
Inline:

```
post UpperCase(output) {
  name[] : $ToUpper(output[*].name[])
}
```

</section>

<section class="zippy">
Existing functions:

```
def UpperCase(arr) {
  name[] : $ToUpper(arr[*].name[])
}

post UpperCase
```

</section>

## Other Keywords

Whistle has various constructs to allow mapping from one JSON structure to
another.

### $root

`$root` is used to denote the input JSON object. `$root` can also be used inside
functions, but is not recommended since it is a strong sign of messy,
non-modular mappings.

### root

`root` can be used inside a function in order to send data to the root of the
output. If there exists an object with the same name, they are
[merged](#merge-semantics).

```
root name: input.patient.name
```

### $this

`$this` is used to set the current object as the return value instead of
creating a new object to return.

```
first_name : FirstName($root.name)

def FirstName(name) {
  $this: $StrSplit(name, " ")[0]
}
```

### out

`out` is used to append output an object to the main output object instead of
only as the return value of a mapping. This is different from `root` which sets
data at the root of the output instead of appending. `out` can also be used
inside a function.

> NOTE: The mapping engine returns an error if the field written to by `out` is
> not an array.

### dest

`dest` is used to read data from the current function's output object instead of
from the input.

## Operators

There are built in arithmetic, logical and existential operators.

### Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)

*   num + num : Addition
*   num - num : Subtraction
*   num * num : Multiplication
*   num / num : Division

### Logical (`~`, `and`, `or`)

*   bool and bool : Logical AND
*   bool or bool : Logical OR
*   ~bool : Logical NOT

### Equality

*   any = any : Equal
*   any ~= any : Not Equal

### Existential (`?`)

*   any? : Value exists or array/string is not empty
*   ~any? : Value does not exist or array/string is empty

### Overwrite (`!`)

In order to prevent data loss and reduce mapping errors, Whistle allows a
primitive (string, numeric, or boolean) field to only be written once. The `!`
operator can be used to overwrite primitive fields.

> NOTE: Overwriting restrictions do not apply to variables.

## Code Harmonization

Code Harmonization is the mechanism for mapping a code in one terminology to
another. The mapping engine uses
[FHIR ConceptMaps](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap.html) to store lookup
tables, and uses a subset of
[FHIR Translate](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/conceptmap-operation-translate.html)
mechanics to do code lookups. Unlike FHIR translate, lookups return an array of
[FHIR Codings](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Coding) on successful
responses.

The lookups can be configured to read from remote servers as well as local
files. Local files are read at startup, and cached for the duration of the
mapping engine instance. When reading from remote servers, the returned codes
are cached. The Time To Live (TTL) and cache clean up interval for this cache is
configurable.

For unsuccessful responses, an error message is returned instead of an an array
of FHIR Codings. In the case of remote servers, the http code and error message
is returned.

### Configuration

See the
[CodeHarmonization protobuf](http://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/blob/master/mapping_engine/proto/harmonization.proto)
for more information on how to configure Code Harmonization.

### Lookup syntax

#### $HarmonizeCode

```go
$HarmonizeCode(lookupSourceName string, sourceCode string, sourceSystem string, conceptMapID string) array
```

Harmonize the provided code to the value specified by the ConceptMap.

Arguments:

*   lookupSourceName: The name of the code lookup block in the CodeHarmonzation
    configuration if remote, or `$Local` for local concept maps.
*   sourceCode: The code to lookup.
*   sourceSystem: The system that the source code is in.
*   conceptMapID: The ID of the ConceptMap to lookup against.

Return: An array of
[FHIR Codings](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Coding) that match.

#### $HarmonizeCodeBySearch

```go
$HarmonizeCodeBySearch(lookupSourceName string, sourceCode string, sourceSystem string) array
```

Harmonize the provided code to the value specified by any ConceptMap. This is
slower than `$HarmonizeCode` as it needs to look at all the provided
ConceptMaps.

Arguments:

*   lookupSourceName: The name of the code lookup block in the CodeHarmonzation
    configuration if remote, or `$Local` for local concept maps.
*   sourceCode: The code to lookup.
*   sourceSystem: The system that the source code is in.

Return: An array of
[FHIR Codings](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Coding) that match.

## Unit Harmonization

Unit harmonization is the mechanism for converting a value in one unit to
another. The mapping engine uses conversion tables defined in the
[UnitConfiguration](http://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/healthcare-data-harmonization/blob/master/mapping_engine/proto/unit_config.proto)
syntax. Conversions return a object that contains:

*   `originalQuantity`: the original quantity
*   `originalUnit`: the original unit
*   `quantity`: the converted quantity
*   `unit`: the converted unit
*   `system`: the unit config system
*   `version`: the unit config version

### Sample configurations

<section class="zippy">
Conversion configuration:

<pre>
<code>

conversion {
  source_unit: "LB"
  dest_unit: "KG"

  codesystem: "metric"
  constant: 0.0
  scalar: 0.453592
}
conversion {
  source_unit: "G"

</code>
</pre>

</section>

### Lookup syntax

#### $HarmonizeUnit

```go
$HarmonizeUnit(sourceValue string, sourceUnit string, sourceCodingSystemArray array) object
```

Harmonize the provided quantity and unit to the specified coding system.

Arguments:

*   sourceValue: The value of the unit to convert.
*   sourceUnit: The unit to convert.
*   sourceCodingSystemArray: The coding system to convert to.

Return: An object with the original quantity and converted quantity as specfied
above.

E.g: `$HarmonizeUnit("50", "KG", [{"system":"metric", "code":"weight"}])`

Output:

```json
{
  "Units": {
    "converted_unit": {
      "originalQuantity": 50,
      "originalUnit": "LB",
      "quantity": 22.6796,
      "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
      "unit": "KG",
      "version": "v1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Comments

Similar to C/Java, lines prefixed with `//` are comments and not part of the
mapping execution.
